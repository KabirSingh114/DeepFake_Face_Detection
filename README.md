This is Group 9's Final Project for CSC 7991. 

We used the code made available as a result of the progress in "FDFtNet: Facing Off Fake Images using Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network" as our starting codebase. 

Our team's primary changes are in what network this architecture was using as it's backbone network (in the /network folder). Our experiments are located in the /jupyter directory.
