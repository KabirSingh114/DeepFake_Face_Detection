This is Group 9's Final Project for CSC 7991. 

We used the code made available as a result of the progress in "FDFtNet: Facing Off Fake Images using Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network" [1] as our starting codebase. 

Our team's changes are primarily studying which backbone networks to apply (network/DenseNet, network/mesonet, network/VGG16), parameter tuning, and any helper methods as necessary. Our experiments are located in the /jupyter directory.
